        <p class="content">Stardew Valley has a lot of different things to do in the game. Farming, obviously, is the
          game's core mechanic, but there is also game mechanics for mining, combat, friendships, and even dating and marriage!
          This guide is here to help you find what items to give to each villager in order to increase your friendship
          level. The rewards for this effort, outside of being the most popular farmer in town, are new recipes,
          resources, and good old fashioned coin.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-title font">Friendship Level</h2>
      <div class="sub-wrap">
        <p class="content">Let's start out with how friendships work. There is a number that is associated with your
          friendship with a NPC. It starts at zero and will increase through interactions with the character. The most
          common and effective interaction for increasing your friendship level is to give that person a gift. Each
          character has gifts that they love, like, are neutral towards, dislike and hate. To make things a little more
          interesting, all of these lists are different for each character.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-title font">What should I do?</h2>
      <div class="sub-wrap">
        <p class="content">There are some things, such as Prismatic Shards, which are universally loved. Except by Haley,
          who hates them. And they are super rare, and they are super valuable. So you probably won't be giving them away
          early on in your playthrough. That is pretty much how these universal lists work. What our aim is here on this
          site it to allow you to decide which items to grow/gather for use as gifts that are somewhat easy to come by if
          you plan ahead.</p>
